### Project Title
US bikeshare data analysis

### Description
This project provides a summary of bikeshare data from US cities, including statistics on time, stations, duration and users.

Data from the following US cities are available for interactive analysis through command line interface:
* Chicago
* New York City
* Washington

### Files used
Raw data came from the following csv files downloaded from Udacity:
* _chicago.csv_
* _new_york_city.csv_
* _washington.csv_

### Credits
I developed _bikeshare_2.py_ based on a template downloaded from Udacity.

The 'print_data' function in _bikeshare_2.py_ uses the `iterrows()` method to iterate through and print each line of raw data in the dataframe. I learned the method from the stackoverflow page below.
